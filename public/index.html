        Hi, I'm Xavi.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 
        More generally I'm trying to understand the world better and develop virtue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently (Sept '25), I won the Entrepreneurs First <a href="https://luma.com/AI-security-hackathon">AI Security Hackathon</a>, 
        receiving £1500 alongside Salim Boujaddi for our proof-of-concept of a C-to-Rust translation CLI. 
        Before that, I came first in the Summer 2023 cohort of the Non-Trivial Fellowship, winning $17,000 with my teammates Beck Peterson and Ludwig Illies. 
        We wrote a policy paper proposing that AI companies make voluntary commitments to proven information security practices from other industries, 
        with the goal of preventing asset theft and reducing AI risk.
    </p>
